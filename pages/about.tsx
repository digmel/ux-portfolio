            I&apos;m Elene, UX/UI Designer with a mission to create delightful
            experiences and lovable products for people! Ever since childhood,
            Iâ€™ve wondered why people make the decisions they do, and find it
            exciting to guess others&apos; emotions, thoughts, or motivations.
            I&apos;ve always loved putting myself in someone else&apos;s shoes
            and later realized that itâ€™s a superb skill named empathy.
            That&apos;s one reason why UX design is so enjoyable to me.

            The skills and views Iâ€™ve gained during my BA (Engineering and
            Computer Science) are essential to UX design. After graduating, I
            became interested in graphic design and worked on freelance
            projects, which led me to take UX Design courses at Google, Idxf,
            and DesignLab. Completing those comprehensive courses helped me
            become a confident UX designer.

            I continued my career in UX research, did several research projects,
            and worked as a UX Researcher at the Bank of Georgia.

            I truly enjoyed being UX Researcher and gained remarkable experience
            that makes me very comfortable working with other researchers.
            During that time, I realized I wanted the entire package of UX, and
            wanted to use my other design skills too. That&apos;s how I moved to
            a design agency as a Product Designer.
