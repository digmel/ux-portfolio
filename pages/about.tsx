            I'm Elene, UX/UI Designer with a mission to create delightful
            experiences and lovable products for people! Ever since childhood,
            Iâ€™ve wondered why people make the decisions they do, and find it
            exciting to guess others' emotions, thoughts, or motivations. I've
            always loved putting myself in someone else's shoes and later
            realized that itâ€™s a superb skill named empathy. That's one reason
            why UX design is so enjoyable to me.

            The skills and views Iâ€™ve gained during my BA (Engineering and
            Computer Science) are essential to UX design. After graduating, I
            became interested in graphic design and worked on freelance
            projects, which led me to take UX Design courses at Google, Idxf,
            and DesignLab. Completing those comprehensive courses helped me
            become a confident UX designer.

            I continued my career in UX research, did several research projects,
            and worked as a UX Researcher at the Bank of Georgia.

            I truly enjoyed being UX Researcher and gained remarkable experience
            that makes me very comfortable working with other researchers.
            During that time, I realized I wanted the entire package of UX, and
            wanted to use my other design skills too. That's how I moved to a
            design agency as a Product Designer.
